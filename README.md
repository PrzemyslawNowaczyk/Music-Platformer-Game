# Music-Platformer-Game

**About the project**

This project's concept emerged in late 2015. It has been developed over the course of 3 months as a part of an engineering thesis. The main goal of project was to create a short, complete game mixing two genres: music games and platformers. It was also a good incentive to learn GameMaker as my first game engine. 

My first attempt to tackle a project that had to be a playable product brought a lot of experience. As the only developer, artist and designer I had to face completely new situations like organizing code in new environment, getting permission to use music track, creating animations, designing levels and implementing mechanisms to synchronise level with music. As the project progressed I was continously learning more about both technical and design aspects of game programming. Inspired by game design blogs run by professionals I decided to make a self-explaining tutorial without any written tips.

Presented version includes fully playable tutorial and first level.

**About the game**

The inspiration for the game has been taken from music levels of Rayman: Legends. First version was a simple rhythmic game, in which green circle was jumping from one red block to another, and player was using only two keys: a short jump and a long jump.

This simple mechanisms quickly depleted their posibilities in terms of gameplay attractiveness. Constant evolution of an idea has brought me to implementing new modules and starting from scratch several times. Game ended up with avatar having freedom of movement, rolls, jumps, turning into a flying bullet and combinations of the above.

Player's goal is to get from the start of the level to the end, performing precise actions in right moments determined by rhythm of background music. Level is loaded with interactive elements. Except dangers, that has to be avoided, there are several elements that, if reached in time, enrich sound of a song and greatly increase amount of points gained.
